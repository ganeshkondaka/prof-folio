I specialize in the <strong> MERN stack, Next.js, and TypeScript,</strong> with a strong focus on DevOps, <strong> AI-powered tools, and open-source contributions</strong>.
                I enjoy working on <strong> cutting-edge projects,</strong> from <strong> AI-driven content generation</strong> platforms to fun and useful npm libraries. My journey includes <strong> contributing to open-source, exploring Docker</strong>, and pushing the limits of modern web development.
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me brainstorming wild project ideas, refining my DevOps skills, or diving into regional Indian accents just for fun!
